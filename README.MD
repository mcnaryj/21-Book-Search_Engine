# 21-Book-Search-Engine

## Book Search Engine

## Description

The purpose of this project is as follows:
1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
4. Deploy the application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas. Use the Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas walkthrough for instructions.
